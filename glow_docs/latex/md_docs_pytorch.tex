{\bfseries Warning\+:} Py\+Torch integration is still under development and does not yet have as much support as Caffe2 model loading.

\subsection*{About}

Import Py\+Torch models to Glow via the \href{https://pytorch.org/docs/master/jit.html}{\tt Py\+Torch J\+IT IR}.

See {\ttfamily glow/torch\+\_\+glow/examples} for illustrative examples.

\subsection*{Setup}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Follow directions in Building.\+md to make sure Glow can be built
\item install \href{https://pytorch.org/}{\tt Py\+Torch} nightly
\item cd to {\ttfamily glow/torch\+\_\+glow}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Usage}

\subsubsection*{Run tests}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily python setup.\+py test} \subsubsection*{Temporarily install while developing on Glow}
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily python setup.\+py develop}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item verify with installation worked with {\ttfamily import torch\+\_\+glow} in Python \subsubsection*{Install}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily python setup.\+py install}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item verify with installation worked with {\ttfamily import torch\+\_\+glow} in Python
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Tips}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use the {\ttfamily -\/-\/run\+\_\+cmake} flag to force rerun cmake
\item Use the {\ttfamily -\/-\/cmake\+\_\+prefix\+\_\+path} flag to specify an llvm install location just like when building glow
\item To disable capturing test outputs and print a lot more test details, add {\ttfamily addopts = -\/s} to {\ttfamily \mbox{[}tool\+:pytest\mbox{]}} in setup.\+cfg 
\end{DoxyItemize}
