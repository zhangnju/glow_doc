class glow\+::detail\+::\+Check\+State$<$ Do\+Checks $>$}

Check\+State$<$\+Do\+Checks$>$ is a common base class for Error and Expected that tracks whether their state has been checked or not if Do\+Checks is true and otherwise it does nothing and has no members so as to not take extra space. This is used to ensure that all Errors and Expecteds are checked before they are destroyed. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
