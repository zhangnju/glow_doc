<div class="textblock"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The CPU Backend is a JIT ("Just In Time") compiler that generates code in memory on demand for the host CPU. The host cpu can be X86, ARM or anything that LLVM can target. In many ways, the JIT is similar to the interpreter. Both execute code on the host CPU, except that the JIT is able to further optimize the code.</p>
<p>The Glow interpreter goes over the low-level IR one instruction at a time and executes a switch statement that dispatches a C++ implementation for each instruction. This is suboptimal for a number of reasons. First, after each low-level instruction is executed, by calling a function call, we return to the dispatch switch-loop. Second, the C++ implementation of the low-level instruction had no knowledge of the specific situation in which the instruction is being executed.</p>
<p>The JIT, on the other hand, generates a single stream of highly optimized instructions that don't go back to the interpreter. Moreover, each instruction is optimized based on specific information on the context in which the instruction is executed. When a matrix multiplication is compiled the JIT knows exactly the dimensions of the matrices that are being executed. The knowledge enables much better code generation and vectorization. The JIT is also able to eliminate all calls to 'malloc', because the memory is statically allocated. The whole network is allocated by a single malloc call, all inputs and outputs a single separate call.</p>
<h3>How the JIT Works</h3>
<p>The JIT accepts the low-level IR. At this point the high-level optimizer and the low-level optimizers did their best to optimize the graph. This includes things like tiling and memory sharing of buffers. The first thing that the JIT does is allocate concrete memory addresses for the AllocActivation instructions in the module. The allocation is done by scanning the module and updating the memory allocator. After this process the allocator reports the high water mark, which is the maximum number of bytes that the network consumes. The allocator assigns offsets for each alloc activation within the buffer. This information is stored in a runtimeBundle where a single call to malloc initializes the heap for activations.</p>
<p>Next, the JIT opens a new LLVM functions and prepares for code generation. The compiler goes over each low-level instruction and generates a sequence of LLVM-IR. The next section describes how the LLVM-IR is generated.</p>
<p>After the LLVM module is generated, the compiler calls the LLVM optimizer to optimize the generated module and the code generator to generate efficient machine code. At this point the compilation phase is complete, and the network is ready for execution.</p>
<h3>Usage of the Standard Library</h3>
<p>During the compilation process, each Glow low-level instruction is converted into a sequence of LLVM-IR instructions. One way to implement this lowering is to use the IRBuilder to generate low-level programs. For example, the matmul instruction would translate to LLVM-IR by creating new basic blocks and encoding the internals of the multiplications. This is insane. Implementing and maintaining the low-level implementations of so many operations using the LLVM-IR is not scalable.</p>
<p>Instead, the CPU backend compiles a small standard library into LLVM bitcode that it ships with the compiler. During the compilation process, Glow loads the bitcode from disk and specializes the operator implementations for the specific context. Glow replaces function arguments that represent the dimensions of some tensor or buffer addresses with constants that LLVM can optimize to generate efficient code. The compiler can decide on the kind and level of operator specialization to perform, and trade compile time and binary size for performance.</p>
<p>Most operators are very simple and the LLVM vectorizer is able to generate very efficient code. Notice that by providing the exact tensor dimensions and loop trip count the vectorizer is able to generate efficient code that does not contain pre-header legality check and scalar loop to handle the remainder odd iterations. The convolution and matrix multiplication operations are hand-optimized in C++ using the clang extended OpenCL vector syntax, and LLVM does a good job allocating registers and encoding the instructions, removing the need to use inline assembly.</p>
<h3>Use Case: Optimizing Resnet50 for the CPU</h3>
<p>In this section, we describe the way that Glow optimizes Resnet50 to generate an efficient stream of x86 instructions. Resnet50 is a residual convolutional neural network that contains 54 convolutions as well as other operators such as element-wise addition, ReLU, batch normalization, max and average pooling, FullyConnected, and SoftMax. Glow optimizes Resnet50 by performing both high-level and low-level optimizations.</p>
<p>First, high-level transformations eliminate redundant transpose operations and merge the batch normalization operation with a convolution node. Next, the CPU backend transforms the graph into a target-specific graph that allows device-specific optimization. The CPU backend identifies three kinds of convolutions: convolutions with a small number of channels, convolutions where the size of the input activation buffer is large, and convolutions where the filter weight buffer is large. Each one of these convolutions requires a different compilation strategy. Next, the target-specific optimizer mutates the graph and generates code that matches the selected convolution. Each convolution kind uses a different filter memory layout and tile size. Below you can see the transformed filter memory layout.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">Filter layout before transformation:</div><div class="line">   [depth, filter_x, filter_y, channel]</div><div class="line">Filter layout after transformation:</div><div class="line">   [depth/N, filter_x, filter_y, channel, N]</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>This 5-dimensional tensor layout allows for consecutive SIMD memory access. The N parameter is selected based on the iteration order and the blocking strategy for the convolution. The CPU backend traverses the graph and replaces any convolutions it would like to optimize in this way with this specialized convolution.</p>
<p>The second parameter that the compiler controls is the size of the convolution tile. Glow selects a processing tile that depends on the size of the first level cache of the processor.</p>
<p>Next, the low-level optimizer optimizes the instruction stream by shrinking the lifetime of memory allocations for the activations, and then performs static memory allocation for the whole network into a single buffer. This reduces the mutable memory footprint of the network. From this point in the compilation pipeline the compiled code can refer to pointers in memory.</p>
<p>Finally, the compiler performs efficient code generation for the non-convolution parts of the network. For example, below the generated assembly for some part of the network can be seen. The compiler fused two unrelated element-wise operations into a single loop. The Add and Max operations are performed on the same memory buffer without reading the memory twice.</p>
